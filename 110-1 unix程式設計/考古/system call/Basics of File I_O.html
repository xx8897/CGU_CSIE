<h1>Basics of File I/O and Stream Objects</h1>

<h2>
Input/Ouput to and from files</h2>

<ul>
<li>File input and file output is an essential in programming.
 <ul>
 <li>Most software involves more than keyboard input and screen user 
     interfaces.</li>
 <li>Data needs to be stored somewhere when a program is not running, and 
     that means writing data to disk.</li>
 <li>For this, we need file input and file output techniques.</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Fortunately, this is <b>EASY</b> in C++!
 <ul>
 <li>If you know how to do screen output with <tt>cout</tt>, and keyboard 
     input with <tt>cin</tt>, then you already know most of it!
 </li><li>File I/O with streams works the same way. The primary difference is 
     that objects other than <tt>cout</tt> and <tt>cin</tt> will be 
     used</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kinds of Files</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Formatted Text</b> vs. <b>Binary</b> files
 <ul>
 <li>A <i>text</i> file is simply made of readable text characters. It 
     looks like the output that is typically printed to the screen 
     through the <tt>cout</tt> object</li>

 <li>A <i>binary</i> file contains unformatted data, saved in its raw 
     memory format.  (For example, the integer 123456789 is saved as a 
     4-byte chunk of data, the same as it's stored in memory - NOT as the 
     9 digits in this sentence).</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Sequential</b> vs. <b>Random Access</b> files
 <ul>
 <li>A <i>sequential</i> file is one that is typically written or read 
     from start to finish</li>
 <li>A <i>random access</i> file is one that stores records, all of the 
     same size, and can read or write single records in place, without 
     affecting the rest of the file</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>(For now, we'll deal with sequential text files)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Creating file stream objects, and attaching to files</h2>

<ul>
<li><tt>cout</tt> and <tt>cin</tt> are <b>objects</b>
 <ul>
 <li><tt>cout</tt> is the standard output stream, usually representing the 
     monitor. It is of type <tt>ostream</tt></li>
 <li><tt>cin</tt> is the standard input stream, usually representing the 
     keyboard. It is of type <tt>istream</tt></li>
 <li><tt>ostream</tt> and <tt>istream</tt> are <b>classes</b></li>

 <li>If you were to have declared them, you might have written:
 <pre>  ostream cout;
  istream cin; 
 </pre>
 </li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>To create file stream objects, we need to include the 
<tt>&lt;fstream&gt;</tt> library:
<pre>  #include &lt;fstream&gt; 
  using namespace std;
</pre>
</li>

<li>This library has classes <b><tt>ofstream</tt></b> ("output file stream")
    and <b><tt>ifstream</tt></b> ("input file stream"). Use these to 
    declare file stream objects:
<pre>  ofstream out1, bob;    // create file output streams, called out1 and bob
  ifstream in1, joe;     // create file input streams, called in1 and joe 
</pre>
</li>

<li>File stream objects need to be attached to files before they can be 
used. Do this with a <i>member function</i> called <b><tt>open</tt></b>, 
which takes in the filename as an argument:
<pre>  out1.open("outfile1.txt");	// for ofstreams, these calls create 
  bob.open("clients.dat");	//  brand new files for output

  in1.open("infile1.txt");      // for ifstreams, these calls try to open 
  joe.open("clients.dat"); 	//  existings files for input
</pre>
</li>

<li>Will <tt>open()</tt> always work?
 <ul>
 <li>For an input file, what if the file doesn't exist?  doesn't have read 
     permission?</li>
 <li>For an output file, what if the directory is not writable?  What if 
     it's an illegal file name?</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
</li>

<li>Since it's possible for <tt>open()</tt> to fail, one should always 
check to make sure there's a valid file attached
 <ul>
 <li>One easy way is to test the true/false value of the stream object 
     itself. A stream that is not attached to a valid file will evaluate 
     to "false"
 <pre>   if (!in1)	// if in1 not attached to a valid input source, abort
   {
	cout &lt;&lt; "Sorry, bad file.";
	exit(0);	// special system call to abort program
			//  may require &lt;cstdlib&gt; to be included
   }
 </pre>
 </li>
 </ul>
</li>


<li>When finished with a file, it can be detached from the stream object 
with the member function <tt>close()</tt>:
<pre>  in1.close();
  out1.close();
  bob.close(); 
</pre>

Note that the <tt>close</tt> function simply closes the file. It does not 
get rid of the stream object. The stream object can now be used to attach 
to another file, if desired:
<pre>  in1.open("infile2.txt");
</pre>
</li>

</ul>
<br>

<hr width="50%" align="left">

<h2>Using file streams</h2>

<ul>
<li>Once a file stream object is attached to a file, it can be used with 
the same syntax as <tt>cin</tt> and <tt>cout</tt> (for input and output 
streams, respectively)</li>

<li>Input file stream usage is like <tt>cin</tt>:
<pre>  int x, y, z;
  double a, b, c;

  in1 &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;	// read three integers from the file
  in1 &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b &gt;&gt; c;	// read three doubles from the file
</pre>
</li>

<li>Output file stream usage is like <tt>cout</tt>:
<pre>  out1 &lt;&lt; "Hello, World\n";	 // print "Hello, World" to the file
  out1 &lt;&lt; "x + y  = " &lt;&lt; x + y;	 // print a math result to the file
</pre>
</li>

<li>A simple example of each
 <ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jestes/cop3014/examples/fileio/set1/numout.cpp">numout.cpp</a> - A 
 simple example illustrating output of data to a file</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jestes/cop3014/examples/fileio/set1/numin.cpp">numin.cpp</a> - A 
 simple example that reads data from the file created by numout.cpp</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Opening a file in 'append mode'</h3>

<ul>
<li>The default way for opening an output file is to create a brand new 
file and begin writing from the beginning
 <ul>
 <li>Note:  If another file with the same name already exists, it will be 
     overwritten!</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Existing files can be opened for output, so that the new output is 
tacked on to the end.  This is called <i>appending</i>.</li>

<li>To open a file in <i>append</i> mode, we use an extra parameter in the 
<tt>open()</tt> function:
<pre>  ofstream fout;			// create file stream
  fout.open("file.txt", ios::app);	// open file in append mode
</pre>
</li>

<li>There are a number of special constants like this one 
(<tt>ios::app</tt>).  This one will cause a file to be opened for 
appending</li>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jestes/cop3014/examples/fileio/set1/numapp.cpp">numapp.cpp</a> - Try 
running this program multiple times in a row, and the view the output 
file</li>

</ul>

<br>


<h3>User-entered file names</h3>

<ul>
<li>File names don't have to be hard-coded as literal strings. We can get 
file names from other places (like user input, other files, etc), but we 
need to store them as variables. This requires some material not yet covered 
(arrays).  Here's what is needed for now.</li>

<li>To create space to store a filename (as a c-style <i>string</i>), we 
declare a set of characters like this:
<pre>  char filename[20]; 
</pre>
This declaration allows storage of a string of up to 19 characters, which 
can be referred to with the variable name <tt>filename</tt></li>

<li>A user can enter a single word name into this variable, with a typical 
call to the extraction operator:
<pre>  cin &gt;&gt; filename;
</pre>
</li>

<li>We can use this variable in the <tt>open()</tt> function when 
attaching a file to a stream:
<pre>  ofstream fout;
  fout.open(filename);
</pre>
</li>

<li>When error-checking to ensure that a valid file was attached, pick a 
technique that's appropriate to the situation. If the user just types a 
filename wrong, we might want to allow them to try again (instead of 
aborting the program).</li>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jestes/cop3014/examples/fileio/set1/userfile.cpp">Here's an example</a> 
that illustrates writing an output file with a user-chosen filename. Note the 
error-checking used in this example</li>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~jestes/cop3014/examples/fileio/set1/userio.cpp">Another example</a> -- 
illustrating user-entered filenames for both input and output</li>

</ul>

<br>

<!--

<h3><tt>eof()</tt></h3>

<ul>
<li>Another useful member function of the input stream classes is 
<tt>eof()</tt>
 <ul>
 <li>stands for <b>end of file</b></li>
 <li>returns a <tt>bool</tt> value, answering the question "Are we at the 
     end of the file?"</li>
 </li>Can be used to indicate whether the end of an input file has been 
      reached, when reading sequentially</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Very useful when reading files where the size of the file or the 
    amount of data to be read is not known in advance</li>

</li>
 
<pre>
  char ch;
  while (!in1.eof())	// while not at the end of the file
  {
     in1.get(ch);	// read a character
     cout &lt;&lt; ch;	// print character to screen
  }
</pre>
