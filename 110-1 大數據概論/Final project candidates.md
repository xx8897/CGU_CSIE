---
Short reminder:

1. At least run the code.
2. Demo some results, we recommend to put some pictures not provided by default to see if the algorithm is robust in some situations. Discuss if it is appliable in practice or not.
3. Knowing where is the training code (train image/ network/ hyperparameters/ how they collect data) and shot it in the presentation.
4. Explain the idea of the work would be a bonus.
